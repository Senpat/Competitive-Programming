Squidward is really annoyed of Patrick and Spongebob's antics so in order to maintain his sanity, Squidward made a game and he would like you to play it.

You are given $Q$ queries ($1 <= Q <= 200000$) which includes either a $\textbf{+}$ or $\textbf{-}$ operation and a number $A$ ($1 <= A <= 10^9$). $\textbf{+}$ operation means to add $A$ to an initially empty array and a $\textbf{-}$ operation means to remove one instance of A from the array. It is guaranteed the $\textbf{-}$ operation will be valid, that is, there will be at least one instance of A in the array. After each operation, output the bitwise OR of all elements in the array. The bitwise OR of all elements for an empty array is assumed to be 0.

You can read more about bitwise operations here: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation}
